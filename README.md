This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug involving the use of the universal selector (*) within a child selector. The bug is characterized by an inefficient and potentially problematic styling approach that can lead to unexpected behavior and performance degradation. The solution provides a more targeted and efficient way to achieve the same styling result.  This is a great example of how seemingly simple CSS can have hidden performance implications.
