The following CSS code uses an invalid selector that may cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:  .container > * { color: blue; } This selector attempts to style all direct children of the element with the class "container". However, the '*' universal selector can be inefficient and may unintentionally affect elements you don't want to style.  It's often more efficient and maintainable to target specific elements or classes within .container.
